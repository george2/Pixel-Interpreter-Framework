Pixel-Interpreter-Framework
===========================

Takes string and determines what command to send and where to send it. The modules folder contains different command classes that inherit from the base command class. Each class needs a "name" variable in it outside of the class that identifies what the name of the class is. The name must match the class name for it to work (i.e. lights.py contains the class "Lights" that has a variable of name with the value of "Lights)
